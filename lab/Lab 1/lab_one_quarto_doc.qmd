# Big Header

##### Smaller Header

###### Smallest Header

Filler text. Also, I think the header number coordinates with size - Header 1 is the biggest and Header 6 is the smallest. This corresponds to the number of hashes in the source code. Maybe there is also a color difference? The space only shows up in the rendered document if I use the br thing

<br>

<br>

## In-line code

<br>

This first part is where we include the in-line code

```         
There are `r nrow(cars)` observations in the cars dataset,  and `r ncol(cars)` variables.
```

<br>

This second part is where we actually run the code - otherwise, it won't show up. You need to run it, and then the variables will show up in the in-line code sentence.

```{r}
#| label: In-line code practice
nrow(cars)
ncol(cars)
```

<br>

<br>

## Practice Image insertion

<br>

R markdown syntax goes in plain text not in code chunks - remember this!

<br>

Practice inserting an image - you can't have spaces in any part of the file path to do this, so name folders accordingly.

<br>

Not sure why, but it doesn't want me to use the full file path, just images/file name

Might be a good idea to come back to the knitr::include_graphics() thing later because the image rendering is taking so long

Anyway, here is the photo that finally rendered...

<br>

<center>I want to try to center this text...</center>

[...and right align this text]{style="float:right"}

<br>

Yes, that worked!

<br>

## Code chunk options

```{r}
# label this code chunk
#| label: code chunk practice one

# random simple practice code
var1 <- 10+2
var2 <- 4+6
var3 <- var1+var2
var3
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# label this code chunk
#| label: another code chunk

# more practice code
var4 <- 11*2
var4
```

```{r}
# label this code chunk
#| label: yet another code chunk haha

#more code
var5 <- var4-var3
var5
```

<br>

# Exercise 2

## Add table of contents

See lab instructions for styling it, shows up when you make the screen wider
