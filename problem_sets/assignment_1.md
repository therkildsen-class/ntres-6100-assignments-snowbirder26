# Assignment 1: Quarto template
Hannah Pryor

## Instructions: Please read through this before you begin

- This assignment is due by **10 pm on Thursday 09/04/2025.**

- For this assignment, please **reproduce this markdown file exactly as
  shown** using Quarto (including this list of instructions). You do
  **NOT** need to fill out the code chunks (i.e. answer the questions)
  for this assignment. We are just practicing markdown formatting right
  now.

- Please name your Quarto file `assignment_1.qmd`

- Set the output format to `gfm` to produce the correct `.md` file for
  github rendering.

- Pay attention to all the formatting in this file, including bullet
  points, bold characters, inserted code chunks, headings, text colors,
  blank lines, and etc. You will need to reproduce all of these.

- You will use the product of this assignment as a template for your
  fourth assignment, where you will actually fill out the code chunks.

- You will have to submit your assignment through GitHub. You can
  complete your template after Thursday’s class, but don’t worry about
  submitting it until after we have gone over how to submit it through
  GitHub in next Tuesday’s class. To do so, you will first move
  `assignment_1.qmd` and `assignment_1.md` to the `problem_sets` folder
  in your own GitHub repository that you have created in class though
  GitHub Classroom. (If you haven’t created this repo yet, please use
  the following url: <https://classroom.github.com/a/StaRJQLV>). Then,
  you can stage these files, make a commit, and push the commit.
